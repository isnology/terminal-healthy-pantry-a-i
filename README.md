# Coder Academy Project

 By Shaun Soo and Glenn Marks

## Breif

 Build a treminal based app in ruby of our choosing using at least 2 gems and 3 classes

 Given 2.5 days spanning over a weekend (4.5 days really)

## Description

We chose to build a smart pantry app where you pass the contents past a scanner when taking it out of the pantry. If the contents was not completly used it was placed back (in a different section of the pantry to denote partial use and no longer in the pantry system app)

The system can scan in and out and produce an email of a shopping list to send to the registered email address.

Not written but propossed is a system that would auto generate a shopping list on a set cycle or raise a warning if an item was about to run out.

## Gems used

  curses
  rubygems
  websocket-client-simple
  mail

### General

  The code needs a little clean up as some methods should be in other existing classes
